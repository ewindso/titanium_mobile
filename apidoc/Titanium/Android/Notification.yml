notes: If you pass contentTitle and/or contentText into <Titanium.Android.createNotification>, then setLatestEventInfo will automatically be called with those properties (there's no need to call it separately unless you want to). You can also use a custom layout.xml wrapped in a <Titanium.Android.RemoteViews> object in the contentView property, which gives more fine grained control and customization to how the notification actually behaves.
